# CarND-Submission1-Cordella
My submission for the Lane Lines Project

The code for this project is in the [ipython notebook](https://github.com/nickcordella/CarND-LaneLines-Submission1/blob/master/P1.ipynb). Raw images and videos are held in the [test_images](https://github.com/nickcordella/CarND-LaneLines-Submission1/blob/master/test_images) and [test_videos](https://github.com/nickcordella/CarND-LaneLines-Submission1/blob/master/test_videos) directories, while the videos with lane lines annotated are in the [test_videos_output](https://github.com/nickcordella/CarND-LaneLines-Submission1/blob/master/test_videos_output) directory. Representative images for my processing pipeline is in [test_images_output](https://github.com/nickcordella/CarND-LaneLines-Submission1/blob/master/test_images_output).

Please read the [writeup](https://github.com/nickcordella/CarND-LaneLines-Submission1/blob/master/writeup.md) for more detailed thoughts on the project!
